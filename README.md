# Code Refactor - Accessibility Challenge

This project demonstrates my ability to refactor code given a set of requirements. It is about a ficticious marketing agency called Hori*seo*n that wants their webiste code base updated to meet accessibility standards and to improve search engine optimization. You can try out the flow using a [screen reader](https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-products/screen-readers).
